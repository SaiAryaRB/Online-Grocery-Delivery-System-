SwiftCart - Grocery Delivery System
Overview
SwiftCart is a Python-based grocery delivery application that allows users to browse grocery items, add them to a cart, and place orders. The system features a simple and intuitive GUI built with Tkinter and uses a text file as a database to manage inventory and process orders.

Features
User-Friendly Interface: The application uses Tkinter for a clean and interactive user interface.
Dynamic Background: The app features a changing background for a more engaging experience.
Product Management: Products are stored in a text file database, making it easy to add, remove, or update items.
Shopping Cart: Users can add items to a cart, view their cart, and remove items before confirming an order.
Order Confirmation: After confirming an order, the app calculates the total price and updates the inventory.

Dataset Structure
The product information is stored in a text file (dataset.txt). Each line in the file represents an item and follows the structure:
ItenName, Price , Quantity
